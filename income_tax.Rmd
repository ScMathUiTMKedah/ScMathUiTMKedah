title: "Income Tax"
description: |
  Welcome to the MAT112 BUsiness Mathematics Courseweb. In this post I have provided a short notes on income tax chapter. This will help the students to learn the topic under each section at ease. The content of each section has been designed in such a way that it is easy for students to follow the materials covered at your own pace. Each section will start with an introductory short video on the topic, then followed with a slideshow presentations and short notes with solved examples. Finally students will end the learning process by solving the exercises on their own. I hope you enjoy it!
